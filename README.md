# easyAI
easyAI aims to help data scientists apply Deep Learning models to traditional machine learning problems (e.g. non image/speech). The primary benefits are:
* Easy to use. Some neural network model attributes are pre-configured to the best knowledge of the author to tackle the specific use case
* Automated neural network structure and parameter tuning. The learning functions will test various model configurations and select the best model based on performance
