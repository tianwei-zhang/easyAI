\usage{
dl_regression_single(x, y, complexity, dropout, lr, validation_split, num_epoch,
  num_patience)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{training feature matrix}

\item{y}{target matrix}

\item{complexity}{a vector indicating numbers of hidden units in each layer, e.g. c(3,6,7) means 3 layers with 3, 6, 7 units in each layer}

\item{dropout}{a vector indicating the dropout rate in each layer, e.g c(0.1,0.2,0.3)}

\item{lr}{learning rate for the optimizer}

\item{validation_split}{percent of data used for validation}

\item{num_epoch}{number of epoches to go through during training}

\item{num_patience}{number of patience in early stopping criteria}
}
\value{
returns a list object with three values: 
model: keras model contructed. A keras_model object
loss: a vector containing loss value in each epoch
accuracy: a vector containing accuracy value in each epoch
